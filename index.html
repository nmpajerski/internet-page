I am a designer and teacher from Nebraska living in Sydney. Currently, rethinking financial infrastructure at Fragment.
<br><br>
Previously I led design teams at Afterpay and Plaid putting a human centered lens on the next generation of fintech infrastructure, drove strategy at WeWork to build a smart product suite for office spaces, and led interdisciplinary design teams for five years at IDEO across industries – from finance to transportation.
<br><br>
I am an ex-architect and farmer at heart, who is in love with sidewalks. I received my Masters from Princeton University and Bachelors from the University of Nebraska – Lincoln.
